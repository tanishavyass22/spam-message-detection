# spam-message-detection
# Introduction
This project is aimed at building a spam message classifier using machine learning techniques. The classifier distinguishes between spam and non-spam messages by analyzing the content of the message.

# Files
# spamMessageClassifier.ipynb: 
This Jupyter Notebook contains the entire codebase for the spam message classifier. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and testing.
# Main.py: 
This Python script contains the Streamlit code for the user interface of the classifier. Users can interact with the classifier through this UI to input text messages and receive predictions on whether they are spam or not.

# Requirements
To run the classifier and the user interface, the following dependencies are required:

Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
Streamlit
Scikit-learn
Pandas
NumPy
Nltk
Install the dependencies using pip:
# pip install jupyter streamlit scikit-learn pandas numpy nltk

# Usage
1. Open spamMessageClassifier.ipynb using Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run the notebook cells sequentially to train the classifier and evaluate its performance.
3. Once trained, you can save the model for later use.
4. Open a terminal or command prompt.
5. Navigate to the directory containing Main.py.
6. Run the Streamlit app by executing the following command:
   # streamlit run Main.py
7. Access the user interface through the provided local URL.
8. Enter a message into the input field and click the "Predict" button to see if it's classified as spam or not.

# Additional Notes
Experiment with different machine learning algorithms, feature engineering techniques, and hyperparameters to improve the classifier's performance.

Feel free to customize the user interface (UI) according to your preferences using Streamlit's features.
