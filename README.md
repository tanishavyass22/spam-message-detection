# spam-message-detection

Introduction
This project is aimed at building a spam message classifier using machine learning techniques. The classifier distinguishes between spam and non-spam messages by analyzing the content of the message.

Files
spamMessageClassifier.ipynb: This Jupyter Notebook contains the entire codebase for the spam message classifier. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and testing.
Main.py: This Python script contains the Streamlit code for the user interface of the classifier. Users can interact with the classifier through this UI to input text messages and receive predictions on whether they are spam or not.
