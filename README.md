Introduction
Spam messages pose a significant problem in communication systems, often leading to unwanted solicitations or malicious content. This project utilizes machine learning algorithms to automatically identify and filter out spam messages from legitimate ones.

Dependencies
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python (version >= 3.0)
scikit-learn
pandas
numpy
You can install these dependencies via pip
pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy

Usage
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your_username/spam-message-detection.git

Navigate to the project directory:
cd spam-message-detection

Train the model:
python train.py
After training, you can use the model to predict whether a message is spam or not:
arduino
Copy code
python predict.py "Your message goes here"
Data
The data used for training and testing the model is not included in this repository due to size constraints. However, you can use your own dataset or obtain one from sources like UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Model
The model is built using scikit-learn, a popular machine learning library in Python. We utilize techniques such as TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and classification algorithms like Naive Bayes or Support Vector Machines (SVM) for spam detection.

Evaluation
We evaluate the performance of the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics provide insights into how well the model performs in distinguishing between spam and non-spam messages.
